<p>This is my favorite soup for many reasons. I have had different kinds of soups but not the soup of a dog. So, I hope to taste it one day.<br>I do not like soups of vegetables. I do not eat fruits and I don't take any kinds of vitamins, but I do like animal's soup. My favorite aniamls are pigs and goats, but I would love to eat dogs as well.</p>
