<h2>What are the boards of cricket and how many are there?</h2>

<!-- <!paragraph-->
<p>
	Each country has its own board which administers its activity. There are currently <em>12 test playing nations</em> who are full members of ICC(International Cricket Council). Cricket boards of these countries receive the most budget than others from ICC. Among them there are <strong>three major cricket boards</strong>which are the main source of revenue for ICC. 
	<br>Before delving into the different boards, I would suggest you to throughly go about learning <a href="icc.html">ICC</a>&amp;<a href="acc.html">ACC</a>.
<hr>
		<p>Now let's look at the 3 newest full member cricket nations and their boards:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Afghanistan Cricket Board</em>&mdash;The Afghanistan men's national team epresents Afghanistan in international cricket. Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the mid-19th century, but it was only in the early 21st century that the national team began to enjoy success. The Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed in 1995 and became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 and a member of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in 2003.After nearly a decade of playing international cricket, on 22 June 2017, at an ICC meeting in London, full ICC Membership (and therefore Test status) was granted to Afghanistan. Rashid Khan is the captain.</li>

			<li><em>Cricket Ireland</em>&mdash;The Irish Cricket Union was officially founded in 1923, and is made up of five provincial unions. Its powers initially were strictly limited and it was reconstituted in 1933. It became associate in the same year and full member at the same time with Afghanistan. Current captain is Andy Balbarnie.</li>

			<li><em>Bangladesh Cricket Board</em>&mdash;It is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and T20 International (T20I) status. It played its first Test match in November 2000 against India with a 9 wicket loss in Dhaka, becoming the tenth Test-playing nation.Bangladesh became an associate member of the ICC in 1977, and competed in six ICC Trophies, the leading ODI competition for non-Test playing nations. Ireland was accepted as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council on 6 July 1993. Shakib Al Hasan is the current captain.</li>

		</ol>

		<br>
		<p>Now that you know what cricket boards are let&#39;s look at the top three cricket boards and their financial contributions to the ICC:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Cricket Australia</strong>&mdash;CA was founded in 1877. It is one of the oldest cricket playing nation along with England. Current captain is Pat Cummins. CA contribute around 5-6% to ICCâ€™s net revenue.</li>
			<li><strong>England and Wales Cricket Board(ECB)</strong>&mdash; ECB was founded in 1997. It was affiliated in 1909. It contributes around 12% to ICC.</li>
