<h2>How to play this sport? What are the components?</h2>

<!paragraph-->
<p>Cricket is one of the most complex sport to understand. To fully understand cricket it takes a lot of time. First you need to fully know the components that makes up cricket.</p>

<!description about different components: field, bat, ball,  -->
	<h3> Here are few things that make up cricket:</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Wicket</dt>
	<dd>Wicket has two meanings. One of them is to describe that a batter has been out and the other is for stumps. Here we'll talk about the different ways a batter can get out in other words, how a bowler takes a wicket. <em>LBW</em> is when ball hits body of the player instead of bat. In this case, the bowler can appeal to the umpire and the umpire can raise his finger to give it out or not out. <em>Cought Out</em> is when batter hits ball in the air but it lands in the hands of fielder, similar to baseball.<em>Clean Bowled</em> occurs when bowler bowls the ball in such a manner that it disrupts bails of the wicket.<em>Run Out</em> occurs when a fielding side disrupts the bails of wicket when a batter overcompensates on a run.</dd>
	<dt>Overs</dt>
	<dd>Overs indicates how long a cricket match can go. In most matches each over comprises of maximum of six legal times a bowler can bowl. In a typical One Day match there are 50 overs &mdash; 300 balls, which can last for 3.5 hours. A bowler can bowl 1 over at a time with maximum of 10 overs in the match. In test matches there are no limit to overs, while in t20 there are twenty overs with each player bowling 4 maximum overs. </dd>
	<dt>Runs</dt>
	<dd>The numbers of points a batting side can accumulate is known as runs. One way to accumulate run is to run between the wickets. Every time two batters cross the line between the wickets a run is added to the team. 3 runs is the most a typical player can get while running, but on one instance a batter had got over 600 runs when the ball was stuck in a tree. <strong>Six</strong>is the maximum runs a batter can get in a ball, it happens when ball struck by batter crosses boundry without touching the ground.<strong>Four</strong>is when ball struck by a batter touches the boundry. Extras such as wides and no balls gives a batter an extra run and extra ball to face.</dd>
	<dt>Innings</dt>
	<dd>The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn. If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) have won the match "by four wickets".In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have "won by an innings and n runs", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.There are two innings in most short formats of the game.</dd>
