		<h2>What is ICC?</h2>
<p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa. It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1987. The ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

	<h4>Members of ICC</h4>
	<p>The ICC has 108 member nations currently: 12 Full Members that play Test matches, and 96 Associate Members. Among the 92 only handful regularly play cricket at high level. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup and the T20 World Cup.</p>

	<h3>Laws of Cricket?</h3>
	<p>The Laws of Cricket is a code which specifies the rules of the game of cricket worldwide. The earliest known code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. There are currently 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L") which outline all aspects of how the game is to be played. MCC has re-coded the Laws six times, the seventh and latest code being released in October 2017. </p>
