<h2>History of World Cricket.</h2>

<p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877</p>
&nbsp;<p>There have been several speculations about the game's origins, including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is from 1300 and concerns the future King Edward II playing at &quot;creag and other games&quot; in both Westminster and Newenden. Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century,[11] probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by colonists[11] and to the Indian subcontinent by East India Company mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.</p>
<h3>Growth of International Cricket</h3>
<p> In 1926, both New Zealand and the West Indies were admitted as members, allowing them to play Test cricket against the other sides. However, at this time in the West Indies, cricket was primarily dominated by the white population. Originally, the ICC was not interested in broadening the international popularity of cricket. The organization was reluctant to invite non-commonwealth nations to play. New Zealand was restricted to play three-day test matches. New Zealand and India both became Test playing nations before World War II and Pakistan joined soon afterwards in 1952.</p>
<h2>History of Cricket in USA</h2>
<p>ket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century. Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played on May 7, 1864, believed to be start of the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America.  The Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844 was a tour consisting of the first international cricket match. The match took place between 24 and 26 September 1844 at the St George's Cricket Club's ground at what is now 30th Street and Broadway (then Bloomingdales) in Manhattan.[2] The game was billed as &#39;United States of America versus the British Empire's Canadian Province&#39;Canada won by 23 runs. On the first day, there were from 5,000 to 20,000 spectators and an estimated $100,000 to $120,000 worth of bets were placed on the match.</p>
<p>After the first world war, cricket started rapidly declining in US. Other sports such as basketball, football and volleyball became more popular among the people. Cricket was replaced by baseball by the second world war and today there remain less than one percent of population who follow cricket. In the right, can see some of the old cricket pictures.</p>


<h3>Arrival of cricket stars</h3>
<p>In the 70s the limited overs format started becoming popular. It was 60 over format initially which is changed to fifty over today. Many superstars were being developed from 70s till 2000s. Cricket was dominated by mainly by West Indies and Pakistan for decades, but came <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/sachin-tendulkar-35320"><strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong></a> in the 90s from India who is regarded as &quot;the god of cricket&quot;. He has the record for most number of runs than anybody in the history. He played more than five world cups and helped India win one.</p>
