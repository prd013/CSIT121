<h2>Rankings of Teams</h2>


<p>
	Teams are ranked on the basis of matches played and their performance by using a mathematical formula developed by ICC. The ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings (formerly known as the ICC ODI Championship) is an international One Day International (ODI) cricket rankings system of the International Cricket Council (ICC). After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. Each team's points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating, and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating.
</p>

<h4>Champions Trophy</h4>
	<p>The ICC champions Trophy is the most prestigious tournament in cricket. It doen't occur on specific time-span. It can occur any time the ICC finds the need to organize it. The last time it happened was in 2017 where Pakistan defeated India. World's best teams compete in this tournament in One Day format. The prize money and number of audience in this tournament is comparable to the UEFA champion&#39;s trophy.
<h4> World Cups </h4>
	<p> World Cups are tournaments organized by ICC every four years. It started in 1975, when WI won the first two world cups. After that various other teams have won. During the early 2000s cricket's popularity and revenue was going down due to which new format of cricket was developed, the T20 format. T20 WC have been held since 2006 every two years, but it is the fifty over format which is called the real world cup.</p>
